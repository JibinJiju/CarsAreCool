Most people use cars to go from point A to B, but for others its a hobby and a passion and this website is for the latter. 

### Here is where it starts...

- The Mercedes Three Wheel Patent Motor Car was the first ever internal combustion engined powered "car"
- The title of the first car is often given to the Ford Model T -which instead was the first mass produced combustion powered vehicle

### Here is where the fun begins... 

Though cars are great for public transport, the real fun begins in racing. The Paris-Rouen motor competition is the first real motoring race, and was a revolutionary form of entertainment at the time. The 79 mile course between Paris and Rouen was the battle ground for 25 racers, including bigger manufactures -such as Puegeot- to amatuer drivers, using self made vehicles.

Everyone has a different taste on the things they like. For me, I love classic motorsport vehicles. From older F1 cars to the legends that raced at Le Mas, I love 'em all

### What the future of cars looks like

As electrifaction increases, and gasoline engines start dying down, many enthuasist find the future to be saddening. But there is still alot to look out for.
- Electric vehicles have proven to be just as capable, and maybe even more so
- And Porsche continues it synthetic fuels research to keep the gasoline engine alive, releasing in 2022
